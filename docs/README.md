# Cost

| Description | approx. cost (per Person) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Accommodation | 170€ p.P. (with 30 People) |
| Skipass | ~330€ |
| Food | ~100€ |

**accommodation:** The cost of the accommodation depends on how many people are attending. The accommodation costs ~4.900€ for the whole week. For 30 People it would be ~170€ per person for the whole week. \
\
**skipass:** The cost of the skipass is about 330€ (with group discount) for a six day destination skipass (including the ski areas Saas-Fee, Saas-Almagell, Saas-Grund and Saas-Balen). There are negotiations from our accommodation, so maybe we will get a bigger discount. It will of course be cheaper for you if you don't get a six day skipass and ride less days or if you take another pass with less ski areas in it. \
\
**food:** We will cook ourselve, so the cost for food will not be that high. \
\
Our goal is that this trip will be as cheap as possible. \
Those costs are rough calculations and can vary. We will update you on more exact prices, when we have the number of attendees and the accommodation.

*Discalimer: There will be additional costs like your travel, equipment-rental (if needed), ski course or if you go to a restaurant or après ski. We can't display those costs, because they depending to much on each person*
