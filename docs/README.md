# Cost

| Description | approx. cost (per Person) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Accommodation | max. 200€ |
| Skipass | ~300€ (depends on the ski area) |
| Food | ~100€ |

**accommodation:** The cost of the accommodation depends on how many people are coming on this trip and where we are going. We set a max amount of 200€ per Person for the whole week. \
\
**skipass:** The cost of the ski pass depends on the skiarea. But it will be somewhere around 300€ for a six day skipass. We try to organize a group discount so it will hopefully get cheaper. Of course, if you want to ride less days you pay less because you don't need a six day ski pass. \
\
**food:** We will cook ourselve, so the cost for food will not be that high. \
\
We try to make this trip as cheap as possible. So the more people are coming the cheaper it gets for everyone.

*Discalimer: There will be additional costs like your travel, rental (if you need), or if you go to restaurants. But we cant display those cost because the vary to much*
