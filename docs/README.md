# Cost

| Description | approx. cost (per Person) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Accommodation | max. 200€ |
| Skipass | ~300€  |
| Food | ~100€ |

**accommodation:** The cost of the accommodation depends on how many people are coming and where we are going. We set a max amount of 200€ per Person for the whole week. \
\
**skipass:** The cost of the skipass depends on the skiarea. But it will be somewhere around 300€ for a six day skipass. We try to organise a group discount so it will hopefully get cheaper. It will of course be cheaper for you if you don't get a six day skipass and ride less days. \
\
**food:** We will cook ourselve, so the cost for food will not be that high. \
\
Our goal is that this trip will be as cheap as possible. \
Those costs are just rough calculations and can vary. We will update you on exact prices, when we have the number of attendees and the accommodation.

*Discalimer: There will be additional costs like your travel, equipment-rental (if needed), ski course or if you go to a restaurant or après ski. We can't display those costs, because they depending to much on each person*
