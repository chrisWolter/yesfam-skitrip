# Corona Information

Here we will provide information about corona and the regulations in switzerland as well as our own regulations we are currently planning.

As of now Switzerland lifted almost every restriction, but COVID-19 is still not gone.

<span style="color:red">For our all safety we encourage you to:</span>

- wear a mask in indoor areas and areas that are crowded (lift, supermarkets, etc.) (Not mandatory in the accommodation)
- do at least one Rapid-Test:

  - 5 days before the trip
  - the day before the trip
  - one week after the trip

This is just to keep everyone in the group and yourself safe. So it would be nice if you follow this recommendation.

# Travel and Corona

Currently, Switzerland has no entry restrictions for most countries. However, there are still travel restrictions for a few countries, so please check before your trip if your departure country is on one of the lists.

<span style="color:red">Remember to also check the entry and transit regulations of the countries you're traveling through while going to switzerland.</span>

<span style="color:red">Also don't forget to check what you have to do if you are going back home. In some countries you need to fill a passenger locator form and also need a PCR or Rapid-Test test.</span>

The swiss government provides a tool to check what kind of regulations you have to take care of: [Swiss Travel Check](https://travelcheck.admin.ch/home)

A small tip from us: check those sites a few days and right before you go on the trip. The regulations change constantly, so it might be possible that you have new regulations right before the trip starts.

# Vaccines and Test

Currently all Vaccines that are approved by the swiss government or european union are valid 365 days from when the last vaccine dose was administered. The certificates from EU/EFTA states, Andorra, Armenia, the Faroe Islands, Georgia, Monaco, New Zealand, Serbia, Singapore, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and recognised third countries that are connected to the EU system, are also recognised. If you have a different certificate you have to change it to a swiss one before you arrive. We will provide assistance in that case if you need. \
