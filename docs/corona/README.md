# Travel and Corona

You find important information about entering switzerland here: [Swiss Health Ministry](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/empfehlungen-fuer-reisende/quarantaene-einreisende.html) \
And in a simpler way you can find it here: [Saas-Valley Corona](https://www.saas-fee.ch/en/coronavirus)

The swiss government provides a tool to check what kind of regulations you have to take care of: [Swiss Travel Check](https://travelcheck.admin.ch/home) \
You have to fill out the [passenger locator form](https://swissplf.admin.ch/formular) up to 48h before entering switzerland and also provide a negative test. You get the information about what test you need on the travel check platform. A PCR Test is valid 72h. A POC Test is valid 24h.

<span style="color:red">Remember to check the entry and transit regulations of the countries you're traveling through while going to switzerland.</span>

A small tip from us: check those sites a few days and right before you go on the trip. The regulations change constantly, so it might be possible that you have new regulations right before the trip starts.
Also don't forget to check what you have to do if you are going back home. In some countries you need to fill a passenger locator form and also need a PCR or POC test.
