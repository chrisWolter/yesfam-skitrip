### Chris
Yo, I'm Chris. A 22 years old software developer and photographer from southern germany. Sportwise I really love everything that uses one board so I'm really hyped to go snowboarding (or skiing) with you and all the other members of the yesfam. Maybe you already know me from some meetups I attended or the discord server, and if not, then I am happy to meet you soon. See you on the slopes and during après ski or any other activity. \

Hi, i’m Freddyi, 20 years old and started studying nursing after a virus crossed my plans of travelling the world. I fell in love with skiing above the polar circle, but with the YesFam in the alps it will be as amazing. \

### Joshua
Hey, I'm Josh or Joshua, young 18 years old from Western Germany and still a highschool student but I will hopefully get my degree next year. I love Skiing as much as the yes fam so mixing this two things sounds perfect for me! I'm really looking forward to spend the day on the slope and with Apres Ski with you! \
